softblock bot for Twitter

i've got a Twitter account for developer access. i secured my own name as the username so at least no one else will have my name, but I'd rather discourage other users from following the account with expectations of any sort of commentary from me. so i wrote a softblocker. it's simple enough: blocks any users following the account, unblocks any users blocked by the account -- but not before leaving the user with a small blessing. rests for a minute between calls to appease the Twitter API. deployed via docker into the cloud, where it runs in perpetuity.
